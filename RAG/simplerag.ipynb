From the smallest plankton to the largest whales, the ocean is home to millions of species, many of which remain undiscovered. The depths of the ocean, which can reach over 36,000 feet in the Mariana Trench, are filled with strange and unique creatures that have adapted to the harsh conditions of life under immense pressure.\\n\\nCoral reefs, often referred to as the rainforests of the sea, are teeming with life and biodiversity. These reefs provide shelter, food, and breeding grounds for countless marine species. However, they are also under threat from climate change, pollution, and overfishing. Efforts to conserve and protect these delicate ecosystems are crucial to maintaining the balance of life in the ocean.\\n\\nThe ocean also plays a vital role in regulating the Earth's climate. It absorbs a significant amount of carbon dioxide and helps to moderate temperatures by distributing heat around the globe through currents like the Gulf Stream. The ocean’s influence on weather patterns is profound, affecting everything from rainfall to hurricanes.\\n\\nIn addition to its ecological importance, the ocean is a source of inspiration and wonder for humans. From ancient myths and legends of sea monsters to modern-day explorations of shipwrecks and underwater caves, the ocean has always captured the human imagination. Whether it’s the thrill of surfing on waves, the tranquility of diving beneath the surface, or simply standing on the shore and gazing out at the horizon, the ocean has a way of connecting us to something greater.\\n\\nAs we continue to explore and learn more about the ocean, it’s essential that we do so with respect and care.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

In hospitals, pathogens\\npresent in waste remain in the air in the form of spores. This can result in hospital acquired\\ninfections and is an occupational health hazard. In congested areas, slums and rural areas\\nburning of firewood and biomass results in lot of smoke. Children and ladies exposed to\\nsmoke may suffer from acute respiratory problems which include running nose, cough,\\nsore throat, lung infection, asthama, difficulty in breathing, noisy respiration and wheezing.\\n(ii) Prevention and control of indoor air pollution\\nUse of wood and dung cakes should be replaced by cleaner fuels such as biogas, kerosene\\nor electricity . But supply of electricity is limited. Similarly kerosene is also limited. Improved\\nstoves for looking like smokeless chullahs have high thermal efficiency and reduced emission\\nof pollutants including smoke. The house designs should incorporate a well ventilated\\nkitchen. Use of biogas and CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) need to be encouraged.\\nThose species of trees such as baval ( Acacia nilotica ) which are least smoky should be\\nplanted and used. Charcoal is a comparatively cleaner fuel. Indoor pollution due to decay\\nof exposed kitchen waste can be reduced by covering the waste properly . Segregation of\\nwaste, pretreatment at source, sterilization of rooms will help in checking indoor air pollution.\\n(iii) Prevention and control of industrial pollution\\nIndustrial pollution can be greatly reduced by:\\n(a)use of cleaner fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) in power plants, fertilizer\\nplants etc. which is cheaper in addition to being environmentally friendly .\\n(b)employing environment friendly industrial processes so that emission of pollutants and\\nhazardous waste is minimized.\\n(c)installing devices which reduce release of pollutants. Devices like filters, electrostatic\\nprecipitators, inertial collectors, scrubbers, gravel bed filters or dry scrubbers are\\ndescribed below:\\n(i)Filters  – Filters remove particulate matter from the gas stream. The medium of a filter\\nmay be made of fibrous materials like cloth, granular material like sand, a rigid material\\nlike screen, or any mat like felt pad. Baghouse filtration system is the most common\\none and is made of cotton or synthetic fibres ( for low temperatures) or glass cloth\\nfabrics (for higher temperature up to 290oC).\\n(ii)Electrostatic precipitators (ESP)-  The emanating dust is charged with ions and the\\nionized particulate matter is collected on an oppositely charged surface.

ESPs are used in boilers, furnaces, and many other units of thermal power\\nplants, cement factories, steel plants, etc.\\n(iii)Inertial collectors –  It works on the principle that inertia of SPM in a gas is higher\\nthan its solvent and as inertia is a function of the mass of the particulate matter this\\ndevice collects heavier particles more ef ficiently . ‘Cyclone’  is a common inertial collector\\nused in gas cleaning plants.\\n(iv)Scrubbers  – Scrubbers are wet collectors. They remove aerosols from a stream of\\ngas either by collecting wet particles on a surface followed by their removal, or else\\nthe particles are wetted by a scrubbing liquid. The particles get trapped as they travel\\nfrom supporting gaseous medium across the interface to the liquid scrubbing medium.\\nGaseous pollutants can be removed by absorption in a liquid using a wet scrubber and\\ndepends on the type of the gas to be removed e.g. for removal of sulphur dioxide alkaline\\nsolution is needed as it dissolves sulphur dioxide. Gaseous pollutants may be absorbed on\\nan activated solid surface like silica gel, alumina, carbon, etc. Silica gel can remove water\\nvapour . Condensation allows the recovery of many by products in coal and petroleum\\nprocessing industries from their liquid effluents.\\nApart from the use of above mentioned devices, other control measures are-\\n•increasing the height of chimneys.\\n•closing industries which pollute the environment.\\n•shifting of polluting industries away from cities and heavily populated areas.\\n•development and maintenance of green belt of adequate width.\\n(iv) Control of vehicular pollution\\n•The emission standards for automobiles have been set which if followed will reduce\\nthe pollution. Standards have been set for the durability of catalytic converters which\\nreduce vehicular emission.\\n•In cities like Delhi, motor vehicles need to obtain Pollution Under Control (PUC)\\ncertificate at regular intervals. This ensures that levels of pollutants emitted from vehicle\\nexhaust are not beyond the prescribed legal limits.\\n•The price of diesel is much cheaper than petrol which promotes use of diesel. To\\nreduce emission of sulphurdioxide, sulphur content in diesel has been reduced to 0.05%.\\n•Earlier lead in the form of tetraethyl lead was added in the petrol to raise octane level\\nfor smooth running of engines. Addition of lead in petrol has been banned to prevent\\nemission of lead particles with the vehicular emission.'),\n",

A musical clock may be nice to listen during\\nthe day , but may be an irritant during sleep at night. Noise by definition is “sound without\\nvalue” or “any noise that is unwanted by the recipient”. Noise in industries such as stone\\ncutting and crushing, steel forgings , loudspeakers, shouting by hawkers selling their wares,\\nmovement of heavy transport vehicles, railways and airports leads to irritation and an\\nincreased blood pressure, loss of temper , decrease in work ef ficiency , loss of hearing\\nwhich may be first temporary but can become permanent in the noise stress continues. It is\\ntherefore of utmost importance that excessive noise is controlled. Noise level is measured\\nin terms of decibels (dB). W.H.O. (W orld Health Or ganization) has prescribed optimum\\nnoise level as 45 dB by day and 35 dB by night. Anything above 80 dB is hazardous.

Water pollution is\\ncaused by a variety of human activities such as industrial, agricultural and domestic.\\nAgricultural run off laden with excess fertilizers and pesticides, industrial effluents with\\ntoxic substances and sewage water with human and animal wastes pollute our water\\nthoroughly . Natural sources of pollution of water are soil erosion, leaching of minerals\\nfrom rocks and decaying of or ganic matter . Rivers, lakes, seas, oceans, estuaries and\\nground water sources may be polluted by point or non-point sources. When pollutants are\\ndischarged from a specific location such as a drain pipe  carrying industrial effluents\\ndischarged directly into a water body it represents point source pollution.  In contrast\\nnon-point sources include discharge of pollutants from diffused sources or from a larger\\narea such as run off from agricultural fields, grazing lands, construction sites, abandoned\\nmines and pits, roads and streets.\\n10.7.1 Sources of water pollution\\nWater pollution is the major source of water born diseases and other health problems.\\nSediments brought by runoff water from agricultural fields and discharge of untreated or\\npartially treated sewage and industrial effluents, disposal of fly ash or solid waste into or\\nclose to a water body cause severe problems of water pollution. Increased turbidity of\\nwater because of sediments reduces penetration of light in water that reduces photosynthesis\\nby aquatic plants.\\n(i) Pollution due to pesticides and inorganic chemicals\\n•Pesticides like DDT and others used in agriculture may contaminate water bodies.\\nAquatic organisms take up pesticides from water get into the food chain (aquatic in\\nthis case) and move up the food chain. At higher trophic level they get concentrated\\nand may reach the upper end of the food chain.\\n•Metals like lead, zinc, arsenic, copper , mercury and cadmium in industrial waste waters\\nadversely af fect humans and other animals. Arsenic pollution of ground water has\\nbeen reported from West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar , Western U.P . Consumption of such\\narsenic polluted water leads to accumulation of arsenic in the body parts like blood,\\nnails and hairs causing skin lesions, rough skin, dry and thickening of skin and ultimately\\nskin cancer .\\n•Pollution of water bodies by mercury causes Minamata disease  in humans and\\ndropsy  in fishes. Lead causes displexia , cadmium poisoning causes Itai – Itai disease\\netc.\\n•Oil pollution of sea occurs from leakage from ships, oil tankers, rigs and pipelines.\\nAccidents of oil tankers spill large quantity of oil in seas which kills marine birds and\\nadversely affects other marine life and beaches.'),\n",

The waste heat from the boilers and heating processes\\nincreases the temperature of the cooling water . Dischar ge of hot water may increase the\\ntemperature of the receiving water by 10 to 15 °C above the ambient water temperature.\\nThis is thermal pollution . Increase in water temperature decreases dissolved oxygen in\\nwater which adversely affects aquatic life. Unlike terrestrial ecosystems, the temperature\\nof water bodies remain steady and does not change very much. Accordingly , aquatic\\norganisms are adopted to a uniform steady temperature of environment and any fluctuation\\nin water temperature severely affects aquatic plants and animals. Hence discharge of hot\\nwater from power plants adversely af fects aquatic or ganisms. Aquatic plants and animals\\nin the warm tropical water live dangerously close to their upper limit of temperature,\\nparticularly during the warm summer months. It requires only a slight deviation from this\\nlimit to cause a thermal stress to these organisms.\\nDischarge of hot water in water body  affects feeding in fishes, increases their metabolism\\nand affects their growth. Their swimming efficiency declines. Running away from predators\\nor chasing prey becomes difficult. Their resistance to diseases and parasites decreases.\\nDue to thermal pollution biological diversity is reduced. One of the best methods of reducing\\nthermal pollution is to store the hot water in cooling ponds, allow the water to cool before\\nreleasing into any receiving water body\\n10.7.2 Ground water pollution\\nLot of people around the world depend on ground water for drinking, domestic, industrial\\nand agricultural uses. Generally groundwater is a clean source of water . However , human\\nactivities such as improper sewage disposal, dumping of farm yard manures and agricultural\\nchemicals, industrial ef fluents are causing pollution of ground water .\\nFig. 10.2:  Figur e showing how the gr ound water gets polluted'),\n",

The enrichment of water bodies\\nwith nutrients causes entrophication of the water body .\\nDischarge of domestic waste, agricultural surface runoff, land drainage and industrial effluents\\nin a water body leads to rapid nutrients enrichment in a water body . The excessive nutrient\\nenrichment in a water body encourages the growth of algae duckweed, water hyacinth,\\nphytoplankton and other aquatic plants.The biological demand for oxygen (BOD) increases\\nwith the increase in aquatic or ganisms. As more plants grow and die, the dead and decaying\\nplants and organic matter acted upon by heterotrophic prtozoans and bacteria, deplete the\\nwater of dissolved oxygen (DO). Decrease in DO result in sudden death of large population\\nof fish and other aquatic organisms including plants, releasing offensive smell and makes\\nthe water unfit for human use. The sudden and explosive growth of phytoplankton and\\nalgae impart green colour to the water is known as water bloom, or “algal blooms”. These\\nphytoplankton release toxic substances in water that causes sudden death of large population\\nof fishes. This phenomenon of nutrient enrichment of a water body is called eutrophication .\\nHuman activities are mainly responsible for the eutrophication of a growing number of\\nlakes and water bodies in the country\\n10.7.4 Methods for control of water pollution and water recycling\\nControl water pollution\\nWaste water from domestic or industrial sources or from garbage dumps is generally\\nknown as sewage.  It may also contain rain water and surface runoff. The sewage water\\ncan be treated to make it safe for disposal into water bodies like rivers, lakes etc. The\\ntreatment involves three stages: primary , secondary and tertiary . This includes 1.\\nsedimentation, 2. coagulation/flocculation, 3.filtration, 4.disinfection, 5.softening and\\n6.aeration. The first four steps are of primary treatment. The first three steps are involved\\nin primary treatment remove suspended particulate matter . Secondary treatment removes\\norganic solids, left out after primary treatment, through their microbial decomposition.\\nEffluents after secondary treatment may be clean but contain large amounts of nitrogen, in\\nform of ammonia, nitrates and phosphorous which can cause problem of eutrophication\\nupon their dischar ge into a receiving water body such as river , lake or pond. The tertiary\\ntreatment is meant to remove nutrients, disinfect for removing pathogenic bacteria, and\\naeration removes hydrogen sulphide and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and make\\nwater healthy and fit for aquatic organisms. This treatment of waste water or sewage is\\ncarried out in effluent treatment plants especially built for this purpose. The residue obtained\\nfrom primary treatment one known as sludge.\\n10.7.5 Water recycling\\nWith increasing population the requirement for water is increasing rapidly .

Therefore, it is essential to utilize the available water with maximum economy .\\nThis involves recycling of waste water for certain uses with or without treatment. Recycling\\nrefers to the use of waste-water by the original user prior to the discharge either to a\\ntreatment system or to a receiving water body . Thus the waste water is recovered and\\nrepetitively recycled with or without treatment by the same user .\\n10.7.6.

There are\\nmany sources of radiation pollution such as nuclear wastes from nuclear power plants,\\nmining and processing of nuclear material etc. The worse case of nuclear pollution was the\\ncherndoyl disaster in Russia occured in 1986 but the ef fects still longer today .\\n10.9.1 Radiation\\nRadiation  is a form of energy travelling through space. The radiation emanating from the\\ndecay of radioactive nuclides are a major sources of radiation pollution. Radiations  can be\\ncategorized into two groups namely the non-ionizing radiations and the ionizing radiations.\\nNon-ionizing radiations  are constituted by the electromagnetic waves at the longer\\nwavelength of the spectrum ranging from near infra-red rays to radio waves. These waves\\nhave energies enough to excite the atoms and molecules of the medium through which they\\npass, causing them to vibrate faster but not strong enough to ionize them. In a microwave\\noven the radiation causes water molecules in the cooking medium to vibrate faster and\\nthus raising its temperature.\\nIonizing radiations cause ionization of atoms and molecules of the medium through which\\nthey pass. Electromagnetic radiations such as short wavelength ultra violet radiations (UV),'),\n",

Electrically charged\\nparticles produced in the nuclear processes can have sufficient energy to knock electrons\\nout of the atoms or molecules of the medium, thereby producing ions. The ions produced\\nin water molecules, for example, can induce reactions that can break bonds in proteins\\nand other important molecules. An example of this would be when a gamma ray passes\\nthrough a cell, the water molecules near the DNA might be ionized and the ions might react\\nwith the DNA causing it to break. They can also cause chemical changes by breaking the\\nchemical bonds, which can damage living tissues. The ionizing radiations cause damage to\\nbiological systems and are, therefore, pollutants.\\n10.9.2 Radiation damage\\nThe biological damage resulting from ionizing radiations is generally termed as  radiation\\ndamage . Large amounts of radiation can kill cells that can dramatically affect the exposed\\norganism as well as possibly its of fspring. Affected cells can mutate and result in cancer . A\\nlarge enough dose of radiation can kill the organism.\\nRadiation damage can be divided into two types: (a) somatic damage  (also called radiation\\nsickness ) and (b) genetic damage. Somatic damage refers to damage to cells that are\\nnot associated with reproduction. Effects of somatic radiation damage include reddening\\nof the skin, loss of hair , ulceration, fibrosis of the lungs, the formation of holes in tissue, a\\nreduction of white blood cells, and the induction of cataract in the eyes. This damage can\\nalso result in cancer and death. Genetic damage refers to damage to cells associated with\\nreproduction. This damage can subsequently cause genetic damage from gene mutation\\nresulting in abnormalities. Genetic damages are passed on to next generation.\\n10.9.3 Radiation dose\\nThe biological damage caused by the radiation is determined by the intensity of radiation\\nand duration of the exposure. It depends on the amount of energy deposited by the radiation\\nin the biological system. In studying the effects of radiation exposure in humans , it is\\nimportant to realize that the biological damage caused by a particle depends not only on\\nthe total energy deposited but also on the rate of energy loss per unit distance traversed by\\nthe particle (or “linear energy transfer”). For example, alpha particles do much more damage\\nper unit energy deposited than do electrons.\\nRadiation effects and radiation doses\\nA traditional unit of human-equivalent dose is the rem, which stands for radiation  equivalen t\\nin man.\\nAt low doses, such as what we receive every day from background radiation (< 1 m rem),\\nthe cells repair the damage rapidly . At higher  doses (up to 100 rem), the cells might'),\n",

Cells changed permanently may go on to produce abnormal cells when\\nthey divide and may become cancerous.\\nAt even higher doses, the cells cannot be replaced fast enough and tissues fail to function.\\nAn example of this would be “radiation sickness.” This is a condition that results after high\\ndoses is given to the whole body (>100 rem).\\nNuclear explosions and accidents in nuclear reactors are a serious source of radiation\\nhazard. The effects of atomic explosions in Nagasaki and Hiroshima are still not forgotten.\\nThe nuclear reactor accident at Chernobyl in 1986 led to deaths of many reactor personnel\\nand a very large release of radionuclide to the environment causing a long term radiation\\ndamage to the people living in the neighboring regions.\\nAccidents at nuclear power plants\\nNuclear fission in the reactor core produces lot of heat which if not controlled can\\nlead to a meltdown of fuel rods in the reactor core. If a meltdown happens by\\naccident, it will release large quantities of highly dangerous radioactive materials in\\nthe environment with disastrous consequences to the humans, animals and plants.\\nTo prevent this type of accidents and reactor blow up, the reactors are designed to\\nhave a number of safety features.\\nInspite of these safety measures two disasters in the nuclear power plants are\\nnoteworthy- namely at ‘Three Mile Island’ in Middletown (U.S.A.) in 1979, at\\nChernobyl (U.S.S.R.) in 1986. In both these cases a series of mishaps and errors\\nresulted in over heating of the reactor core and lot of radiation was released into the\\nenvironment. The leakage from Three Mile Island reactor was apparently low and\\nno one was injured immediately . However , in case of Chernobyl the leakage was\\nvery heavy causing death of some workers and radiation spread over large areas\\nscattered all over Europe. People of the city had to be evacuated to safer places\\nand the plant had to be closed down. These two disasters are a reminder that\\nnuclear power reactors require a constant up gradation of safety measures. Accidents\\nwith nuclear submarines also points to the same.\\n INTEXT QUESTIONS 10.5\\n1.Which type of radiations are produced in a microwave oven?\\n______________________________________________________________\\n2.State the use of absorbed dose of radiation.\\n______________________________________________________________\\n3.How much of radiation can damage internal organs upon its exposure for a few days.\\n______________________________________________________________'),\n",

The depths of the ocean, which can reach over 36,000 feet in the Mariana Trench, are filled with strange and unique creatures that have adapted to the harsh conditions of life under immense pressure.\\n\\nCoral reefs, often referred to as the rainforests of the sea, are teeming with life and biodiversity. These reefs provide shelter, food, and breeding grounds for countless marine species. However, they are also under threat from climate change, pollution, and overfishing. Efforts to conserve and protect these delicate ecosystems are crucial to maintaining the balance of life in the ocean.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'speech.txt'}, page_content=\"The ocean also plays a vital role in regulating the Earth's climate. It absorbs a significant amount of carbon dioxide and helps to moderate temperatures by distributing heat around the globe through currents like the Gulf Stream. The ocean’s influence on weather patterns is profound, affecting everything from rainfall to hurricanes.\\n\\nIn addition to its ecological importance, the ocean is a source of inspiration and wonder for humans. From ancient myths and legends of sea monsters to modern-day explorations of shipwrecks and underwater caves, the ocean has always captured the human imagination. Whether it’s the thrill of surfing on waves, the tranquility of diving beneath the surface, or simply standing on the shore and gazing out at the horizon, the ocean has a way of connecting us to something greater.\"),\n",
